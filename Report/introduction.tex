\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
In this era, a large amount of structured and unstructured data became available.
\textbf{Machine Learning} (\textbf{ML}) has evolved as a branch of artificial
intelligence: it envisages the development of self-learning algorithms, which are
capable of acquiring knowledge from data with the aim of making predictions.
Instead of requiring a human presence who manually enact the rules and
build models for the analysis of large amounts of data, machine learning offers
a more efficient alternative to capture the knowledge in the data. Machine learning
aims to gradually improve the performance of forecasting models and
to make data driven decisions.
In this section we will examine the three different types of machine learning:
\emph{supervised learning}, \emph{unsupervised learning} and
\emph{reinforcement learning}.
Where we will show the fundamental differences between these types of
learning.\cite{raschka2016machine}

\subsection{Supervised learning}
\label{subsec:supervised-learnig}
The main purpose of supervised learning is to derive a model from 
training data, which allows us to make predictions for data that are not
available or future.
Here, the term ``supervision" refers to the fact that the output signal labels 
of the sample sets are already known.
A supervised learning task, which is based on discrete class labels, is also 
called a classification task, in figure \ref{fig:supervised-learning-scheme} it 
is possible to observe a process diagram.
Another supervised learning subcategory is regression, whose resulting
signal is a continuous value.
Classification is a sub-category of supervised learning, which has the goal to
provide class category labels for new instances, based on observations made in
the past.
These labels are discrete, unordered values ​​that can be considered as
belonging to a group of instances.
However, the set of class labels does not necessarily have to be a binary
nature.
The predictive model identified by a supervised learning algorithm can consider
each class label that is present in the learning dataset of a new instance, which
is not labelled.\\
A typical example of \emph{multi-class classification} is the recognition of
hand-written text.\cite{raschka2016machine}

\subsection{Reinforcement learnig}
\label{subsec:reinforcement-learnig}
Another type of machine learning is reinforcement learning.
Here, the goal is to develop a system (\emph{agent}) for people to improve
their performance. In order to do so, that system is based on interactions with 
the environment.
Since information relating to the current state of the environment
include also a \emph{reward} signal, we can consider strengthening
learning as an example of supervised learning.
However, this feedback is not the correct label or the
true value of truth, but it represents the quality of the measurement of the 
performance measured by the reward function.
Through interaction with the environment, an agent can then use reinforcement
learning to learn a series of actions, which maximize this reward through a
trial-and-error exploratory approach or deliberative planning.\cite{raschka2016machine}

\subsection{Unsupervised learning}
\label{subsec:unsupervised-learning}
In supervised learning, we know in advance the correct answer when we describe
our model, while in reinforcement learning we define a measure, or reward, for
the specific actions performed by the agent.
In unsupervised learning, on the other hand, we are dealing with unlabelled data
or data from the unknown structure.
Using unsupervised learning techniques, we are able to observe the structure of
our data, to extract meaningful information from them without being able to
rely on the guide nor a variable known relative result, nor a reward function.
Clustering is an exploratory technique of data analysis that allows us to
organize a series of information within meaningful groups (\emph{cluster})
without having any previous knowledge of memberships in such groups.
Each cluster that can be derived during the analysis defines a group of objects
that share a certain degree of similarity, but which are more dissimilar than
the objects present in the other clusters, which is why clustering is sometimes
called \emph{``unsupervised classification"}.
Clustering is an excellent technique for structuring information to identify
meaningful relationships in the data.\cite{raschka2016machine}
